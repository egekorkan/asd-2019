        <h5>WELCOME TO ASD 2019</h5>

        <p class="lead">
            The Autonomous Systems Design workshop is scheduled on March 29, 2019 and will be held
            at Florence, Italy.
        </p>

        <p> This year ASD will be co-located with
            <a href="https://www.date-conference.com/"> Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) 2019</a>.</p>

        <p> The number of intelligent embedded devices continues to multiply rapidly therefore leading to the emergence
            of
            autonomous systems in order to provide highly efficient, safe and secure functions. Autonomous driving
            constitutes
            today one of the best examples of this trend.</p>

        <p> However, with the increase of the level of automation, systems design becomes very challenging in order to
            accommodate the high complexity, connectivity and heterogeneity of the system while complying with rigorous
            constraints in terms of safety, real-time capabilities and security. </p>

        <p>The workshop will explore recent industrial and academic methods and methodologies in autonomous systems
            design.
            This includes several areas:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and
                execute the autonomous system functions including their architectures,
                hardware, software and communication</li>
            <li>The design for autonomous systems
                including processes, modeling, optimization, verification, validation, and test</li>
            <li>All aspects of dependable systems design for autonomous systems including,
                but not limited to, functional safety concepts, fail-operational systems design,
                functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and secure changes
                and updates, autonomous systems security.</li>
        </ul>
