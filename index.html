        <p>ASD is the 1st international workshop on Autonomous Systems Design. The goal of ASD is to explore recent
            industrial and academic methods and methodologies in autonomous systems design.
            This includes several areas:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system
                functions
                including
                their architectures, hardware, software and communication.</li>
            <li>The design for autonomous systems including processes, modelling, optimization, verification,
                validation,
                and test.</li>
            <li>All aspects of dependable systems design for autonomous systems including, but not limited to,
                functional
                safety
                concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning,
                safe
                and
                secure
                changes and updates, autonomous systems security.</li>
        </ul>

        The workshop consists of regular
        sessions with peer-reviewed research papers selected from an open call, complemented
        by invited talks on robotics, automated driving and frameworks for autonomous
        systems like ROS and AUTOSAR Adaptive.

<h6><b>Keynotes</b></h6>

        This year, the workshop will have two distinguished industrial keynotes highlighting
        important challenges and recent trends in the fields of autonomous design. In his
        keynote "Challenges of Automated and Connected Driving", Thomas Form, Head of
        Electronics and Vehicle Research at Volkswagen AG, will talk about the challenges in
        automated driving regarding sensor technologies, redundancies as well as verification
        and validation questions. Masaki Gondo, CTO at eSOL, the company that provides
        POSIX/AUTOSAR/TRON RTOS will talk about AUTOSAR Adaptive as a standardized software
        platform specification for the highly automated and autonomous driving and emphasize
        the role of OS architectures in coping with recent challenges in the field.

<h6><b>Exhibition & Interactive Discussion</b></h6>


        An exhibition area will include interactive presentations with posters during which all presented papers are
        discussed with the authors. The exhibition area will also involve the following demonstrators,

        <ul>
            <li>Autonomous robots exploring an unknown area using a run-time update to a state of the art environment
                perception and trajectory planning system used in the research vehicle MOBILE. The demonstrator aims at
showing the applicability of the concepts developed in the <a href="http://ccc-project.org/">CCC project</a> to the
                domain of automated driving.
            </li>
            <li>Autonomous racing competitions where small cars explore a track concurrently with other cars and use
                perception, planning and control in order to avoid crashing and complete the track. This demonstrator
is part of the <a href="https://www.date-conference.com/conference/fringe-meeting-fm03-0">F1/10 International
    Autonomous Racing Competition </a>. It will be presented by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy and is supported by IEEE CEDA.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <br> -->
        The exhibition area will be available to all attendees of the workshop.
