<!-- Welcome to ASD 2019, co-located with DATE 2019


ASD is the 1st international workshop on Autonomous Systems Design. The goal of ASD is to explore recent industrial and
academic methods and methodologies in autonomous systems design. This includes several areas:
1) embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system functions including
their architectures, hardware, software and communication, 
2) the design for autonomous systems including processes, modelling, optimization, verification, validation, and test
3) all aspects of dependable systems design for autonomous systems including, but not limited to, functional safety
concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and secure
changes and updates, autonomous systems security. 
While not excluding other application areas, the initial focus of ASD 2019 will be on autonomous vehicles and their
infrastructure. -->

<h6>Welcome to ASD 2019, co-located with DATE 2019</h6>

        <!-- <p class="lead">
            The Autonomous Systems Design workshop is scheduled on March 29, 2019 and will be held
            at Florence, Italy.
        </p> -->

        <!-- <p> This year ASD will be co-located with
            <a href="https://www.date-conference.com/"> Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) 2019</a>.</p> -->

        <!-- <p> The number of intelligent embedded devices continues to multiply rapidly therefore leading to the emergence
            of
            autonomous systems in order to provide highly efficient, safe and secure functions. Autonomous driving
            constitutes
            today one of the best examples of this trend.</p>

        <p> However, with the increase of the level of automation, systems design becomes very challenging in order to
            accommodate the high complexity, connectivity and heterogeneity of the system while complying with rigorous
            constraints in terms of safety, real-time capabilities and security. </p> -->
